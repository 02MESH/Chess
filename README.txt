I still not got the main file working but I have finished the GUI from which my game will run. 
To check how the GUI function run the main.py file, no buttons there except exit works.
Similarly, I have not got online mode working.
To check the AI capabilities, execute the engine.py file in the modes folder.

For testing the modes individually, please go the single mode testing folder and execute the
singleplayerENGINE.py or multiplayerENGINE.py to see how the code functions.
